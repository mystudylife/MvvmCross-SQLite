### Fork Info
This is a fork of the MvvmCross plugin, combined with the extensions from https://bitbucket.org/twincoders/sqlite-net-extensions

There are a number of fixes and performance improvements including:
- ManyToOne foreign keys for collections
- SoftDeletionAttribute (only implemented in ReadOperations.cs when loading related entities)
- Reducing number of queries to database
- Addition of async connection locking
- Added (`ExecuteDeferredQuery`)[https://github.com/mystudylife/MvvmCross-SQLite/blob/experimental/Sqlite/Cirrious.MvvmCross.Community.Plugins.Sqlite/SharedFile/SQLiteNet.cs#L2240] overload that allows a single row to be mapped to multiple objects.
- Added (`GetWithChildrenInSingleQuery`)[https://github.com/mystudylife/MvvmCross-SQLite/blob/experimental/Sqlite/Cirrious.MvvmCross.Community.Plugins.Sqlite/Extensions/ReadOperations.cs#L23] (experimental) extension method that uses the above mentioned method to automatically load related entities in a single query (ManyToOne and OneToOne only).

The long term goal is to refactor this into manageable chunks whilst expanding sqlite-net's support for foreign keys. It's likely for a while it will stay in a state where it serves our projects needs until we get some time to give it some TLC.
